# Prompts
## Please describe why you are interested in this role

While studying business at Boston University, I spent a lot of my time working with tech startups. I learned that I'm attracted to the entrepreneurship space primarily because in order to succeed, one needs to deliver new value to their customer base while balancing the underlying technical constraints. If they can't excel in both of these dimensions, they fail. I'm interested in this role because it has similar demands in terms of execution of technology strategy. I was very impressed by the new Boston site, and would love to help build upon its successes by adopting a beginner's mindset to collaboratively create seamless user experiences, especially with accessibility as a first-class concern.

I'd also appreciate the opportunity to give back to Boston, the first US city I called home, by serving its constituents using the skills I've dedicated the past few years to acquiring.

## In the City of Boston, if you have a dog that's older than six months you must get them licensed. The [online application](https://www.boston.gov/departments/animal-care-and-control/how-license-your-dog/) is on our product roadmap for improvement. How would you think about enhancing this online experience? What would your process look like? What challenges do you foresee? How would you address them? Our expectation is that this is not an extensive plan, we're more interested to hear in brief your approach to the project.
