# Netlify - standing out by emphasizing user experience

## What is it?

[Netlify](https://netlify.com) is a hosting provider for static sites.

## Interacting with hosting providers is frustrating

Hosting providers invoke thoughts of cryptic, unfriendly, and aesthetically out-of-date dashboard UIs that are so unintuitive that users tend to look for third party guides to accomplish even the simplest of tasks. Poor customer service tends to follow, worsening the sense of frustration. All of this leads to users picking the least of all evils when choosing a provider, rather than which one will have the most delightful experience.

## Netlify competes on user experience

Most providers treat the market as a crowded one where pricing is the only frontier left to compete on. Netlify is disrupting this space by instead focusing on experience, to the extent that most of its new business is generated through developers raving about how easy it is to get started.

## Interfaces are uncluttered and approachable

As early as the [landing page](./landing-page.png), the site begins to convey how simple working with Netlify is, not just with the demo of a simple use case ("Deploy your site in seconds"), but also through its soft, pleasing design that makes the user feel encouraged rather than intimidated.

Once signed up and logged in, users can quickly [deploy their first project using a multi-page form](./deploy-new-project.png) that stores state when navigating back and forth on pages, gives definitions of more technical terms when hovering over help icons, and even prepopulates build commands by scanning through the config files in the project, delighting the user in the process.

Once the site has been published, it can be managed through [the dashboard](./dashboard.png). All settings are organized by concern in an intuitive fashion, with the most major concerns (e.g. recent contact form submissions) having greater detail than others in their unexpanded state.


## Lessons
It's clear that the Netlify team adhered to a few key principles when designing the experience:
- Break pages and page content by concern so that users can discover their desired setting easily without feeling overwhelmed
- Anticipate users' needs when possible (e.g. prepopulating build commands), improving their learning curve and inducing delight
- Use fun illustrations and design elements where possible, creating a sense of enjoyment
